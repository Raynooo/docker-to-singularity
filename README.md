# What it does    

Transforms a given _Docker_ image into a _Singularity_ one.

# Setup required: env variables    
  
Some environment variables must be set so the conversion script knows which image to transform and how to call the output:
 * $IMAGE_REPO is the image's repository name
 * $IMAGE_TAG is the image's tag
 * $SOFTWARE_NAME is the name given to the image's software

## Command-line    

```docker run <options> --privileged <image_name>```

## Config file

To use your .env file simply add it to the command line this way:    
```docker run --env-file config.env ...```    
You can also set them at runtime without using the _-e_ flag:      
```docker run -e "IMAGE_TAG=jessie" -e "IMAGE_REPO=debian"```

### Saving data    

The converted _Singularity_ image is stored on the container's */convertdir* mounted directory. This means that you should mount this volume on the host machine to keep the produced image.
This is shown below in the example using the _-v_ argument:    
``` docker run -v <host_absolute_path>:<container_path>```

# Example    

## Environment file (ie: _demo.env_)      

```
IMAGE_REPO=debian    
IMAGE_TAG=jessie     
SOFTWARE_NAME=debian-jessie     
```   
 
## Command line (supposing the image was built and called _singularity_)

```docker run --env-file example.env --privileged -v /usr/local/test-output:/convertdir singularity```
